My crossword projects are available on this page for anyone to try :)\n\n\n\nUConn Themed Puzzle (Completed Dec 19, 2024)\n\nThis puzzle includes many clues inspired by my time at UConn as an undergrad (and now as a graduate student!). This is the first puzzle I’ve ever completed and I might have overlooked some typical puzzle making rules in the process. I didn’t maintain perfect rotational symmetry and there are a couple two letter words which is usually looked down upon. With that in mind, I still really enjoyed this first attempt at puzzle making!\nCrossword puzzle with clues (pdf)\nCompleted puzzle with correct answers (pdf)"
