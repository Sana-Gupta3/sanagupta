#### Welcome to my crossword collection!
##### I've always enjoyed attempting crossword puzzles and recently I have been working on a few of my own! My crossword projects are available on this page for anyone to try :)

### UConn Themed Puzzle (Completed Dec 19, 2024)
##### This puzzle includes many clues inspired by my time at UConn as an undergrad (and now as a graduate student!). This is the first puzzle I've ever completed and I might have overlooked some typical puzzle making rules in the process. I didn't maintain perfect rotational symmetry and there are a couple two letter words which is usually looked down upon. With that in mind, I still really enjoyed this first attempt at puzzle making!
